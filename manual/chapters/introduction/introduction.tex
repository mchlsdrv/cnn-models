\section{Projects' Goal}
The main goal of this project is to facilitate quality assurance of samples in a nano-scale, i.e., to design an easy, cheap and reliable first step detection mechanism. Our system is design to answer a simple question - does the sample contain the target (e.g., virus, microb, chemical etc.) or not, the particulars are omitted, and thus the time saved! As in many cases the particulars are not really that important (e.g., we don't care what kind of contamination is there in the food product, if it has any - we should through it), so the very fact of particulars omitment is our main strength, as it saves time!
